Steps by Jan. 15th:

1) Make it work with STRIPS; translate between strips and normal actions.
2) Find good ways to translate back, and record full states (and their sequences).
3) Find a way to "abstract an acion away" and later use it for planning.
4) STRETCH: write down the recursive plan, and find a way to use it for planning.
	-- From there, abstract the details away.

It's clear that I can slowly move in the direction of "an agent that plays with plans," but
I don't remotely have the full picture in mind yet.

Therefore, this must go in tandem with learning DRL, then the Grokking stage, the o2p2 reimplementation.

Best I can show the profs is the recursive plan, and maybe dicts with preferences on what to match.
